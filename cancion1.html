            <h3>Letra de la cancion</h3>
                <p>I know they ain't feelin' my pain<br>
                    I got codeine inside my veins, yeah<br>
                    I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill<br>
                    We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense<br>
                    He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in<br>
                    Lil' homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end<br>
                    They offerin' the shooter the death penalty, won't tell on me<br>
                    I know if I go broke today, them same hoes gon' bail on me<br>
                    I got them throwin' salt, they steady tryna fuck up my recipe<br>
                    Amiri jeans, a hundred a pair, ain't nothin' about a nigga cheap<br>
                    Sellin' weed in the projects, relapsed on the Hi-Tech<br>
                    Told the gang that we up next, put 'em on a G5 jet<br>
                    Overseas with my sidepiece, my queen, she gotta be a dimepiece<br>
                    We gon' stick together like assigned seats, on that Dej Loaf, nigga, try me<br>
                    Whoever thought I'd put a hundred on my neck?<br>
                    Whoever thought that I'd say I'm the one up next?<br>
                    Whoever thought they'd ever consider me the best?<br>
                    Whoever thought, whoever thought, whoever thought?<br>
                    I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill<br>
                    We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense<br>
                    He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in<br>
                    Lil' homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end<br>
                    Go and ask about me in the streets, they heard of me<br>
                    If she find out I been creepin', she gon' murder me<br>
                    I ain't trippin', no complaints, I got my currency up<br>
                    Out of town, I let the windows down, so they can see us<br>
                    I take the hitters around the globe, that's all I know (that's all I know)<br>
                    I met her last night she tried to give me her soul (give me her soul)<br>
                    I got 'em hatin', they throwin' shots, they on their toes<br>
                    One thing they know (One thing they know)<br>
                    One thing they know (One thing they know)<br>
                    Ain't gon' let up on them niggas, once you try us, ain't gon' stop<br>
                    If it's pressure, let me know, so we can pull up with them Glocks<br>
                    Tryna dodge the bullshit and tryna make it to the top<br>
                    If I never sell a record I'ma make it on the block<br>
                    How you gon' wait 'til I make it then try to help me? Nigga I don't need you (no help)<br>
                    I put the food on the table, nigga was hungry, I tried to feed you<br>
                    Treat all my niggas like bosses, nobody better, everyone equal (yeah)<br>
                    Real talk, this the sequel, hold it down for my people<br>
                    I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill<br>
                    We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense<br>
                    He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in<br>
                    Lil' homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end<br>
                    I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill<br>
                    We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense<br>
                    He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in<br>
                    Lil' homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end<br>
